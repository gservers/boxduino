> History:
> 2013.08.29 - Some small clean-up of code, more sensible variable names etc.
>                Added another example code for multiple buttons in an object array
> 2013.04.23 - A "minor" debugging: active-high buttons now work (wops)!
>                Thanks goes to John F. H. for pointing that out!
> 2013.02.17 - Some improvements, simplified click codes.
>				Added a LED fader example. Thanks to Tom K. for the idea.
> 2012.01.31 - Tiny update for Arduino 1.0
> 2010.06.15 - First version. Basically just a small OOP programming exercise.
