## BOXduino - the first Arduino powered e-cigarette!

Using Arduino to take care about Your e-cig

Currently working:
  * Sleep / Power on
  * Firing
  * Read input voltage
  * Very simple control
  * Battery indicator and ohmmeter (pretty accurate)
  * (Almost) perfect scheme in Fritzing

Cons:
  * No display implemented (yet)
  * Power consumption > 100mA  

Switch VV / Bypass: Turn the potentiometer to 0 and short press the fire button.   
Power off: Turn the potentiometer to 0 and hold the fire button.  
Power on: Hold the button.
