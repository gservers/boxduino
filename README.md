## BOXduino - the first Arduino powered e-cigarette!

Using Arduino to take care about Your e-cig

Currently working:
  * Sleep / Power on - makes BOXduino more powersaving!
  * Firing - I don't need to explain this one
  * Read input voltage - Watch battery level!
  * Battery indicator (pretty accurate) - with awesome bettery graphics!
  * (Almost) perfect scheme in Fritzing, but still needs an update
  * Nice display! - Pretty fine and readable layout
  * Screen dimming! - afer 10 seconds without any action the screen will be dimmed. 
  * Standard control - see controls below

Currently unavaiable:
  * Ohmmeter
  * Backlight
  * Dynamic refreshing (printing stuff takes A LOT of time and Arduino can't comply updating screen and button data as fast as I need)  

Controls:  
* Refresh everything: 1x click  
* Fire: Hold the button  
* Switch VV / Bypass: 3x click  
* Night mode (inverting display): 4x click
* Power off: 5x click  
* Power on: Hold the button (while off)  
* Serial debug: 6x click  
* Wakeup the screen: 1x click
