## BOXduino - the first Arduino powered e-cigarette!

Using Arduino to take care about Your e-cig

Currently working:
  * Sleep / Power on
  * Firing
  * Read input voltage
  * Very simple control
  * Battery indicator
  * Ohmmeter
  * (Almost) perfect scheme in Fritzing

Cons:
  * No display (yet), only serial communication  
  * Non-English comments (gonna change)  
  * Power consumption > 100mA  
  
Check Issues for ToDo list.  

##Feel free to add new suggestions!
